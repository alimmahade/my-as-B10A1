          Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers. While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates, these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites.[1] Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.[4] Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

                  <p>I started learning to program three months back. When I started, I knew that I wanted to build awesome apps and websites. Firstly, I started to learn on my own. The process of learning HTML and CSS on my own was great but sometimes I used to get stuck a lot at some topics and wasn’t able to get through it. I felt that I need a strong mentorship and then I started to search for any software development boot camps that can help me learn the required skills, got few options, researched about them and I liked the one named AltCampus. AltCampus which is situated in the small Himalayan town Dharamshala. AltCampus trains you to become a full-stack developer in 6 months with no upfront fees. </p>

<h1>
  My Inspiration
</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, let me introduce myself. My name is Sergei Garcia, and I’m a full-time front end developer with 2 years experience. In that time, I’ve worked as a front-end developer for both a Forbes 500 consulting firm and a small company.

  This may not sound like a lot of experience, but finishing my second year as a developer has been a huge milestone for me. This is because I had no real experience doing web development — and not much programming experience in general beyond some basic C# and Java training I got from a few online courses. I also didn’t have a computer science degree since I graduated with a degree in IT project management.
